# Broken dynamic viewport units

Reproduction of unstable work of dynamic viewport units in different browsers on IOS (maybe there is also android browsers, but I failed to reproduce the behvaiour) 

[dynamic-viewport.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1eae0f59-e93b-4b45-be80-eb2b645c8da0)

This behaviour causes cumulative layout shift when `min-height: 100lvh` used
